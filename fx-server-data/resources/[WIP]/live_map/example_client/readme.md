# This is an example client-side resource!

This shows you how you can create your own resources to utilise LiveMap.

If you want to use LiveMap, I suggest you do it in your own client resource.

This will allow you to update LiveMap without any conflicts.

If you wanted to use this version of the client, and keep the data how it is, I suggest you copy these files into their own folder.

# How to enable

Uncomment the client_files bit in the manifest file!
